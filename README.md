# Flask-MongoDB Web App

### App Title: To-Do App
### Description
I created a To-Do app in which the user can input any text and it will be added to a list of to-do items. As part of the app, I implemented several features to help the user guide through their list.

Features:
- A count on the number of items they have on their to-do list <br>
- The ability to delete all to-do items <br>
- The ability to search for a specific to-do item <br>
- The ability to edit a particular to-do item <br>
- The ability to delete a particular to-do item<br>
- To-Do list organized by impending deadlines<br>
